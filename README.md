# Mostly True

Introducing my first redesign for [Mostly True](https://mostly-true.life/)

This is a heavily modified version of [Astro Micro ðŸ”¬](https://astro-micro.vercel.app/) that I like to call Yak Micro. Maybe Micro Yak. Maybe Mighy Yak.

Astro Micro is an accessible theme for Astro. It's a fork of [Mark Horn's](https://github.com/markhorn-dev) popular theme [Astro Nano](https://astro-nano-demo.vercel.app/). Like Nano, Micro comes with zero frameworks installed.

ROADMAP:

- [] Remove TailwindCSS
- [] Add a bento-style header for the front page
- [] Play with the footer. [https://humme.qodeinteractive.com/our-process/](I really like this one).

Thank you, Enjoy!
