# Mostly True

Introducing my first redesign for [Mostly True](https://mostly-true.life/)

This is a (very) heavily modified version of [Astro Micro ðŸ”¬](https://astro-micro.vercel.app/) that I like to call Yak Micro. Maybe Micro Yak. Maybe Mighty Yak.

Astro Micro is an accessible theme for Astro. It's a fork of [Mark Horn's](https://github.com/markhorn-dev) popular theme [Astro Nano](https://astro-nano-demo.vercel.app/). Like Nano, Micro comes with zero frameworks installed.

Thank you, Enjoy!
